# Book-Price-Analysis

In this project, I delve into the world of book pricing and explore the various factors that influence it. By utilizing web scraping techniques, I gather a comprehensive dataset that includes essential features like book genre, author reputation, publication date, and more. All the data will be aquired through web scraping using **BeautifulSoup** and **Undetected Chrome Driver**.

- Data are scraped using the **BookShop_Scrape.ipynb** from the website <i>https://bookshop.org<i> and exported to book-rescrape.csv (chromedrive.exe will be necessary for undetected_chromedriver to work)
- All the other processes including Data Cleaning, EDA, Model Construction are inside **Book_Analysis.ipynb**

This project is the result of collective efforts from our team.
